One Tap Sign Up & Email Link Sign In
=============

.. role:: red

This is a new update since v1.3.0. :red:`Enable this feature in the plugin is not enough. You also have to configure in (Google Cloud Platform) GCP & Firebase.`.

Password is becoming obsolete. Remembering username and password in order to login to a website maybe easy, how about 10 websites?

So, how about one-click to login & sign up to WordPress & Firebase?

One-tap Sign-up
```````````````````

This is a feature from `Google <https://developers.google.com/identity/one-tap/web/>`_. Sign up new users with just one tap, without interrupting them with a sign-up screen. Users get a secure, token-based, passwordless account on your site, protected by their Google Account.

This is straight forward. Users enter their email, and they will get a sign-in link in their inbox. They click on the the link and sign in to WordPress and Firebase at the same time.
