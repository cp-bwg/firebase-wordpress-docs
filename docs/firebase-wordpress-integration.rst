How to integrate Firebase to WordPress
=============

I’m not sure why you want to integrate Firebase and WordPress together because they are two seperate system. The authentication is different too. But somehow, you end up here and want to combine Firebase and WordPress together. And yes, we can do it.

Download the Integrate Firebase PRO plugin
----------------------------------

There is a FREE version of this `Firebase WordPress integration plugin <https://wordpress.org/plugins/integrate-firebase/>`_ that you can find in WordPress plugin site. You can give it a try, however, the application is very limited. If you only want to interact with Firebase through WordPress frontend only, then the free version would be sufficient enough.

However, if you want a more secured and advanced feature of the plugin. Please support the development of `Integrate Firebase PRO <https://firebase.dalenguyen.me>`_ version.

Installation Process
----------------------------------

After you have downloaded the plugin, you can use default installation process in order to install the plugin. Otherwise, you can always manually upload the plugin to your plugin folder through FTP client.

After you activate the plugin, you need to enter the Firebase credential in the **Settings > Firebase**.
